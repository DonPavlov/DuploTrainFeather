# DuploTrain ESP32 control 
This is a Project Trying to create a new PCB to control Duplo Trains using, nothing more than just the ESP32-S3 and a safer Lipo Battery (LifePo4) including a charge circuit for it.


## Errata
After receiving the PCB the following are issues currently needing to be fixed:

* NeoPixel Leds are shining down.
* Cherry-Switches Holes are not fitting. The holes are too narrowly spaced. This results in only beening able to use microswitches. Have used a bad reference user implementation.
* A Control Chip could not be sourced from EasyEda and needs to be handsoldered testing inconclusive.

Fixes are currently not actively worked on.
